# Automatic-Attendance-Management-System-

This project develop in python language & store database also.

Current attendance activities are mostly done on paper using biometric system. The
manual method of student attendance marking process was found to be tedious, especially
when carried out for large number of students, this makes the entire process time consuming
error-prone.
Automated solution using proposed system covering the most important drawback of manual
system namely speed, simplicity. The proposed system is focused on marking the attendance
automatically and generate analysis report.
Recognition of human face is an important domain in unique identification of humans. This
method is develop for taking attendance of students in a classroom which integrate the face
detection technology.
The proposed system capture the image of the students in class room environment and by
processing on image attendance will mark automatically on report.
